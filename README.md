# Remindly (JavaFX App)

**Remindly** is a desktop application I'm building as part of my journey to learn Java and JavaFX. The main goal of this app is to let users create, view, and manage simple tasks or reminders.

This project is helping me learn and practice:

- Object-oriented programming in Java
- JavaFX for building graphical user interfaces
- FXML to separate the view from the logic
- Connecting to a PostgreSQL database
- Good practices like separating the code into layers: model, service, DAO, and controller

The application is still in early development, and I'm currently working on features such as:

- Adding new tasks
- Displaying tasks from the database
- Basic input validation
- Styling the app with CSS

My goal is to improve my skills and learn to structure a real application step by step.  
Thanks for checking out this project! ðŸš€
